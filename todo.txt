Add !some_bool_var by checking if the first token is `!` and the token after which should be an ident is a boolean variable
The same should be done with deciding if you should parse an int boolean expression or a bool boolean expression
This should be done in the parseBoolTerm function
add true and false in the parsing

Parsing is Done!
